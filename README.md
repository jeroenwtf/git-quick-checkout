A CLI tool to list and switch recent Git branches, sorted by the latest commit.

## Features

- Select branches from a list using a keyboard interface.
- Sort branches by their most recent commit.
- View the last commit message, author, and relative timestamp for each branch.
- Checks for uncommitted changes before switching branches.


## Installation

```bash
npm install -g git-quick-checkout
```

My recommendation is to set an alias for it that works for you, like `git qco` or `gqc`.
